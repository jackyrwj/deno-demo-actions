# Deno Demo Actions

A collection of example GitHub Actions powered by [Deno](https://deno.land/), demonstrating various use cases and best practices for building modern, secure, and efficient automation workflows.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This repository showcases different types of GitHub Actions built with Deno, including:

- **Basic Actions**: Simple examples to get you started
- **Web Scraping**: Actions that fetch and process web content
- **API Integration**: Examples of working with external APIs
- **Data Processing**: Actions for transforming and analyzing data
